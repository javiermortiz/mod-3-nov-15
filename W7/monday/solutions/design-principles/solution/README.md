# Discussion Design Principles

In this discussion, go to a website and look around the site. Discuss with your
partner what you like, dislike and what you would change. Make notes of what
design features or flaws that notice.

Feel free to go to a website you already enjoy or take a look at:
<!-- Instructors can talk about these websites and how the design concepts are
good, bad, or could be improved. -->
Some notes that might help lead the discussion:

It's worth noting that these websites break many of the design conventions
discussed in the reading, yet are very popular. Why is that?

CraigsList and Reddit are very plain, but it's easy to find (CraigsList) or
browse (Reddit) what's there.

Paul Graham's website is primitive, but that lets you know you're there for the
writing, which is excellent. His page routes, for those who know about routing,
are similarly excellent:  http://paulgraham.com/simply.html

GitHub is great for browsing repos but the homepage is pretty bad. But who
visits the GitHub homepage anyway? There's probably some very specific subset of
users who use the homepage, but most developers will probably never use it. It's
no doubt optimized for some other set of users.

Supreme is a very interesting case. Despite being a worldwide design company and
brand, their site breaks a lot of standard design conventions. It may be
interesting to discuss how and why they do so, because it's definitely done
intentionally by expert designers. Their current front page (as of April 2021)
has tiny, unreadable navigation but a massively prominent logo. This is
definitely intentional, but it's important to learn the rules before you break
the rules.

One thing that these sites all have in common is simplicity: Take away
everything that does not matter to emphasize what does matter. For CraigsList
and Reddit, it's finding the category you want. For GitHub it's navigating code
repos. For Paul Graham, it's timeless essays. For Supreme, it's the logo above
everything else.

These sites also cater to a fairly narrow group of users, whether it's
developers for GitHub or tech savvy youths for Supreme. A widely used site like
Instagram, Facebook or even Twitter must be usable by anyone and also be
aesthetically pleasing. So, it's more important that they be "slick" with UI
that does not break any conventions.
