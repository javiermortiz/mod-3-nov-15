    <question>
        <p>Which of the following is considered quadratic growth in Big-O?</p>
        <li>O(2<sup>n</sup>)</li>
        <li>O(1)</li>
        <li correct>O(n<sup>2</sup>)</li>
        <li>O(n)</li>
        <explanation>O(n<sup>2</sup>),A quadratic task requires a number of steps equal to the square of it's input value.</explanation>

    <question>
        <p>Which one best describes a Breadth First Search(BFS)?</p>
        <li>Post-order Traversal, we traverse the left subtree, then the right subtree and finally the root node.</li>
        <li>In-order Traversal, the left subtree is visited first, then the root and later the right sub-tree.</li>
        <li correct>Level Order Traversal, the nodes are visited at each level from left-to-right.</li>
        <li>Pre-order Traversal, the root node is visited first, then the left subtree and finally the right subtree.</li>
        <explanation> The correct answer is Level Order Traversal, where the nodes are visited each level from left-to-right.</explanation>
