The purpose of web design is to make your site simple, accessible and intuitive.

Arguably, the most important design principle is white space. 

“Whitespace,” or “negative space” is the space between elements in a composition.

Let’s take the following example before any whitespace is applied:

Everything is pretty cramped. We need to add whitespace to create harmony and visual comfort in the design. Let me add margins, padding and also increase the line-height.

(comment out the css rule)

Within this content is something that I want the reader to pay extra attention to: the title and the subheading. Notice how the whitespace around the element draws your eye to it.

Whitespace not only creates harmony, and balance, it can also be used to lead a reader from one element to another. 

Our main goals are to make the website look simple and uncluttered and to deliver information that our readers will enjoy and appreciate.
